Ansible JBoss EAP Role
=================

A role to install JBoss Enterprise Application Platform on RHEL7. Intended to be used with [JBoss Middleware Playbooks](https://github.com/rhtconsulting/ansible-middleware-playbooks)

Transfer Method
------------

This role supports a few different mechanism for transferring the product zip files to the target host. These are documented on [the main playbooks README](https://github.com/rhtconsulting/ansible-middleware-playbooks), as the methods are supported across a variety of roles.


Dependencies
------------

- java
- unzip

Our playbooks provide these dependencies in a [common role](https://github.com/rhtconsulting/ansible-middleware-playbooks/tree/master/roles/common), but this there is no explicitly ansible dependency to allow end users more options.
